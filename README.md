# ADVENT OF CODE 2017

This year instead of eating a chocolate per day till Christmas, just solve a small programming problem each day :).

## How to test the code?

Inside each folder there's a cpp file that you can compile and create an exe file doing:
```
gcc day_x.cpp -o day_x
```
Check program for each day to see how to execute. But the pattern is `day_x <part [1|2]> <args>`.
